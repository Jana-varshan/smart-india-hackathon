# 🛡️ Real-Time Bug Alert System for Enterprises  
> Smart India Hackathon 2025 Finalist Project

## 🔍 Overview

This project is a full-stack web application that monitors and scrapes publicly available bug and vulnerability reports across the software world. It analyzes the **severity** of reported bugs and **notifies enterprise teams** if any of the services or technologies they use are affected — enabling **early action** to prevent exploitation.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Manual monitoring of vulnerabilities is slow and inefficient. Enterprises often discover security issues only after their systems are exploited. Our system automates this process, giving real-time alerts based on relevance and severity, making security **proactive instead of reactive**.

## 💡 Key Features

- 🌐 **Web Scraping**: Collects vulnerability and bug reports from trusted public sources.
- 📊 **Severity Analysis**: Categorizes issues using keywords, CVE scores, and frequency.
- 🛠️ **Custom Company Profiles**: Each organization registers services/APIs used in their stack.
- 🔔 **Smart Notifications**: Sends real-time alerts when relevant bugs are detected.
- 📈 **Dashboard**: Visual interface to view bugs by date, severity, affected service, etc.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

| Area         | Technologies Used                                  |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend     | React.js, Bootstrap                                |
| Backend      | Node.js, Express.js                                |
| Web Scraping | Python (BeautifulSoup / Selenium)                  |
| Database     | MongoDB                                             |
| Other        | REST APIs, Cron Jobs, Notification Logic, GitHub   |

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Python scraper runs periodically to fetch latest vulnerability reports.
2. The data is cleaned, tagged, and analyzed for severity.
3. If a report matches a service used by a registered organization, a notification is triggered.
4. Users can monitor live feeds through the web dashboard.
